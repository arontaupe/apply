# Introduction


I am Aron, a recent graduate of the bachelors program of Cognitive Science in Osnabr√ºck. 
During my very open and broad studies, I focused mostly on Computational Linguistics, Machine Learning, and Philosophy.
The mix of these topics you will find scattered through my [Portfolio](/portfolio/)

I am enthusiastic about many of the topics included there and have developed a fondness of algorithmical problems, philosophical considerations and issues of our society. 

I live together with 4 awesome humans, a cat, and two 3D Printers and am currently restaurating a van as my temporary home for the summer before moving to Berlin to start my awesome master's project.

I dream of one day having my own bar with cultural events and am already working on the perfect recipe for homebrew beer. I love experimenting, whether that is in the kitchen, finding a solution to a coding problem or creating useful objects. 

I am also passionate about [3D Printing](/printing/) and all of its curious applications, as well as all areas tangent to it.
The interface of technology and the world interests me and coming up with ways for one sphere to interact with the other has now captured me for some years. 

I recognize a collosal environmental problem that the current and following generations are faced with, global waste being just one tiny aspect of.
At the same time, I am thoroughly frustrated that I have to pay for the plastic that goes into my printer while I throw the packaging of my food away, being the exact same material.
Even more frustrating are the established norms for recycling that lead to virtually none of the products that I can produce with the printer at home being recyclable.
[Plastic waste](/plastic-recycling/) is no joke and I consider it my personal contribution to try to help advance small scale, decentralized recycling.
I am currently searching for an appropriate place to further my knowledge to automatize the recycling of my own very large collection of failed prints.

With the experience of using and troubleshooting 3D Printers, I discovered more and more that while the mechanical and practical side of the machines is fascinating to me, the thing I really love is creating things. 

So, I started to learn [CAD](/cad/) and am really loving it. 
But even though studying Cognitive Science is a really openminded and diverse framework and affords me the possibilities to explore many of my personal interests, 3D Design does fall a bit out of the picture. After my own really bumpy dive into Fusion360 I really wish to engage further with object design. 

While the technical part of creating the object now comes rather easy to me, I am often struggling to transcend the established way of doing it. In my mind there are two kinds of creativity involved here: one for problem solving and one that puts aesthetical considerations and usability first. Those two kinds are certainly intertwined and they may not be dissectable, I still feel that my background makes me lean towards practical problem solving, ignoring other aspects. 
It may seem unintuitive that I am coming forward asking to learn to be more impractical but I identify this as a logical next step comprising good holistic design. 

Another big aspect in my studies is the critical approach towards the world. I am particularly interested in who and what gets to decide in technological environments. I started out looking at state theory, went via the curricular and rather classical philosphy of mind debates on to a philosophy of emotions, got friends with embodied cognition, and slowly circled back to more normative social theories, looking at postphenomenology, feminist theory of science and Foucault.


# Motivation

I understand myself as a transdisciplinary and project-oriented person.
