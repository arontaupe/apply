# Introduction
I am Aron, a recent graduate of the bachelors program of Cognitive Science in Osnabr√ºck. 

I am enthusiastic about many of the topics included there and have developed a fondness of algorithmical problems, philosophical considerations and issues of our society. 

I dream of one day having my own bar with cultural events and am already working on the perfect recipe for homebrew beer. I love experimenting, whether that is in the kitchen, finding a solution to a coding problem or creating useful objects. 

I am also passionate about 3D Printing and all of its curious applications.
The interface of technology and the world interests me and coming up with ways for one spere to interact with the other has now captured me for some years. 
I recognize a collosal environmental problem that the current and following generations are faced with, global waste being just one tiny aspect of.
At the same time, I am thoroughly frustrated that I have to pay for the plastic that goes into my printer while I throw the packaging of my food away, being the exact same material.
Even more frustrating are the established norms for recycling that lead to virtually none of the products that I can produce with the printer at home being recyclable.
Plastic waste is no joke and I consider it my personal contribution to try to help advance small scale, decentralized recycling.

With the experience of using and troubleshooting 3D Printers, I discovered more and more that while the mechanical and practical side of the machines is fascinating to me, the thing I really love is creating things. 

I started to learn CAD and was really sad that while the possibilities studying Cognitive Science affords me, 3D Design does fall a bit out of the picture. After my own really bumpy dive into Fusion360 I really wish to engage further with design and am
