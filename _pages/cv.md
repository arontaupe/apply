# Who am I?
I am Aron, and I just finished my bachelor’s degree in Cognitive Science at the University of Osnabrück.

I dream of having my own bar one day and am working on the perfect recipe for homebrew beer.
I live together with 4 awesome humans, a cat, and two 3D Printers.
I love to get into new electronics or building projects.

I am passionate about 3D Printing and many related areas. While I find the I am thoroughly frustrated that I have to pay for the plastic I use for printing while I throw the packaging of my food away, being the exact same thing.
I believe that global plastic waste is a ginormous problem and I consider it my personal field of action to help advance small-scale, decentralized recycling.
I am currently searching for an appropriate place to further my knowledge to automatize the recycling of my own very large collection of failed prints.

During my very open and broad studies, I focused mostly on Computational Linguistics, Machine Learning, and Philosophy.
