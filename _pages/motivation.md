## Why do I want to participate in Design and Computation?

During my bachelor, I had the privilege to already break out of traditional specializing fields and get a feel for how multidisciplinary scientific practice can look. This was in many areas helpful for me and an overall positive experience. What I was crucially missing still was project oriented autonomous research. The departments work closely together, but I see a difference between co-operation and work that transcends disciplines. 

In manufacturing a digital part, all the steps necessary are controlled and executed by me, which is a real feature. Keeping in mind the production constraints through 3D- Printers already while designing gets rid of a host of problems in the whole process. This "Lookahead" practice is worthwhile in many areas of production in my opinion. 
I also felt that there is a difference for me in approaching certain topics without a clear schedule fixed ahead of time versus a even less restricted explorative work that was not present in Osnabr√ºck. 

I hope to find a framework enabling me to explore topics and skills needed to advance the recycling project. In trying to find a masters program enabling me to pursue ideas that are central to me, like the recycling project and other ideas around responsible and sustainable living.
