# Motivation
## Why do I want to participate in Design and Computation?

During my bachelor, I had the privilege to already break out of traditional specializing fields and get a feel for how multidisciplinary scientific practice can look. Douglas Hofstadters Book "Gödel, Escher, Bach" is much heralded as a classic for us in Cognitive science, and during the first semesters that book accompanied me and gave some insights of referentiality that I would have missed otherwise. So I was delighted to find him on the Website with the Letterspirit project, which is an awesome example of how rule-based constraint solving can factor into design in my mind. 

While I encountered many interesting fields and areas during my time studying in Osnabrück, I found that i am much more at home creating things, which doesn't go naturally with scientific research. This is not to say that I don't value scientific processes, but I do not want to constrain my thought process purely to deductive processes and see what other modes of exploring the world there are. 

Cognitive Science was in many areas helpful for me and an overall positive experience. What I was crucially missing still was project oriented autonomous research. The departments work closely together, but I see a difference between co-operation and work that eliminates all  disciplines. 
Re-orientation of the rather classic notion of expert and novice, which is put forward by the academic world, is of import to me and I would love to see more peer learning practices and less hierarchy in academia. I started working on that by helping to shape the new "DigiLab", an open makerspace intended to offer low-barrier entrance points into digital topics and spaces. While I believe that some value can be transferred now that it will open, I also encountered the many hindrances and fears in our academic setting preventing or slowing down new forms of encountering learning. We had all the toys: VR-Glasses, CNC Machines, Camera equipment, you name it. We found it to be much harder to provide educational value to students than just providing the space and regular opening hours. The question of how to incorporate machines and technology into our lives to our benefit always resurfaced and we had to often circle back to the basic question of "What actually to we want our visitors to achieve?" and how does digitality factor in here? It didnt get much more philosophical there, since I was paid to find practical answers, but not just there, the question of how to be beneficial to society and achieve the good life for all is always relevant and even more so when observing technology.

In manufacturing a digital part, all the steps necessary are controlled and executed by me, which is a real feature. Keeping in mind the production constraints through 3D-Printers already while designing gets rid of a host of problems in the whole process. This "Lookahead" practice is worthwhile in many areas of production in my opinion. 
I also felt that there is a difference for me in approaching certain topics without a clear schedule fixed ahead of time versus a even less restricted explorative work that was not present in Osnabrück. 

I hope to find a framework enabling me to explore topics and skills needed to advance the recycling project. In trying to find a masters program enabling me to pursue ideas that are central to me, like the recycling project and other ideas around responsible and sustainable living. 


I understand myself as a transdisciplinary and project-oriented person.


With the experience of using and troubleshooting 3D Printers, I discovered more and more that while the mechanical and practical side of the machines is fascinating to me, the thing I really love is creating things. 

So, I started to learn CAD and am really loving it. 
But even though studying Cognitive Science is a really openminded and diverse framework and affords me the possibilities to explore many of my personal interests, 3D Design does fall a bit out of the picture. After my own really bumpy dive into Fusion360 I really wish to engage further with object design. 

While the technical part of creating the object now comes rather easy to me, I am often struggling to transcend the established way of doing it. In my mind there are two methods of creativity involved here: one for problem solving and one that puts aesthetical considerations and usability first. Those two kinds are certainly intertwined and they may not be dissectable, I still feel that my background makes me lean towards practical problem solving, ignoring other aspects that I also wich to incorporate. 
So I identify concentrating less on forward-looking problem solving and more on backward-looking design methodology as a logical next step comprising good holistic design. 


Another big aspect in my studies is the critical approach towards the world. I am particularly interested in who and what gets to decide in technological environments. I started out looking at state theory, went via the curricular and rather classical philosphy of mind debates on to a philosophy of emotions, got friends with embodied cognition, and slowly circled back to more normative social theories, looking at postphenomenology, feminist theory of science and Foucault. Accompanying any education really, with a solid framework of what is to be achieved in studiying a particular subject is important to me and something many people tell me they are missing.

Some friends studying in Berlin already told me much about their personal experience with the Course "Kritische Nachhaltigkeit". I am happy to see formats and concepts as these to be part of the regular Schedule in Design and Computation and am looking forward to attending a wide variety of courses, continuing a proud tradition in parts also present and lived during my Bachelor's. 

Another thing that really fascinates me are these huge scheduled spaces for term projects. I will be glad glad to take part in them, to be working as a team on a project that will evolve deeper than a simple group presentation and to interact with peers during some discovery process is something
