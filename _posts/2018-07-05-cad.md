# 3D Modeling and CAD
## Designing 3D Objects

While learning about 3D Printing, I was most intrigued with the possibility to modify and repair existing products. While there is an amazing community with lots of good and free models around, naturally I came to a point where I did not find what I was looking for readily designed. I realized this is an essential skill for effectively operating not just 3D Printers, but any productive machine really.

Since youtube was the place I was learning all about 3D Printing, and all the people that I looked up to there were using Fusion 360 as their CAD Program that’s what I got into.
In hindsight, that was a pretty good choice and I am in love with the abilities parametric design gives me. 
Below you will find some of my own designs. 
The process is something that I enjoy a lot and wish to dive into deeper. 

By trial and error I already learned a lot about designing specifically for 3D Printing, but I often feel that there are many aesthetic considerations in design that I am not familiar with. 
I want to broaden my general ability to design physical objects, which is something I hope to gain during my master’s.

# 3D Scanning and Photogrammetry
Besides coming up with new objects, incorporating the real world is also an interest of mine. 

## Interaction with real objects and environments
In the last few years I have played around with a few smartphone cameras and was always quite sad, that my scans were never quite accurate enough to do cool stuff with them. I could not really afford real 3D scanner and had already started cobbling together a raspberry Pi camera with a cheap TOF sensor, which is a simple, but not quite as good replacement for a laser or a lidar sensor, but then Apple came out with the first phones with accessible Lidar sensor.
Recently, through work at the university I got access to a device with a lidar sensor and started having fun with it. 
See some examples here:
