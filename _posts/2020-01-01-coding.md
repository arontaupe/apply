# Neural Networks and Computer Vision
## A selection of coding projects

I do not see myself as a good coding person. It is not a passion and modern techniques are often overwhelming for me. Nevertheless â€“ I recognize the importance of Neural networks and other recent developments in Computer vision. Here a small selection of projects that I co-authored during my Bachelor Program.


Example of a Super-Resolution Image. The Neural network is artificially adding Pixels so that we can finally put our measly selfie on a billboard poster and not be appalled by our deformed-through-technology face. Find out more

Here, you can also have a look at another, much smaller project, where we rebuilt a rather classical Machine learning approacht for face detection.
