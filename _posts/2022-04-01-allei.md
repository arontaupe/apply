# Meet Ällei - the accessible chatbot
## Sommerblut

Natural Language Understanding really fascinates me and recently I started collaborating with the team of the Sommerblut Festival in Cologne to deliver them a customized chatbot that will be able to communicate with everyone, respecting accessibility standards to really include all people. It will be able to communicate in German Sign Language (DGS), as well as service blind people, and we aim to incorporate the simple language concept. 

I find it to be an amazing challenge to start out with the requirement of really being inclusive. In ordinary social contexts it is often not obvious, but when analyzing the specific needs a plind person has browsing the internet, it is drastically different from a person having impaired hearing. To hold the same conversation with both of them is proving quite a challenge. And this is just the first step down into a very deep field of digital inclusiveness. How can people with a speech impediment use our tool? How do we include people speaking German as a foreign language? 

Such vast challenges are often obfuscated by the technical framework of our digital lives. 

I find digital accessibility a hugely interesting area, one that I am just now starting to explore. 

This is a work in progress. We have some interesting ideas and will present a conceptual prototype, come check again after March 6th, when the 2022 festival started. Or come to the official digital presentation for the bot.

This bot is my first paid software work and I am getting to work with an number of awesome people and teams to realize different parts within the project. Here, i am not responsible for anything in the Front end, the product you will interact with here is by no means finished and may not respond at times, since we are moving and restarting it for production purposes.
Nevertheless, all the intended core features of the bot are present and you can try it out there in the corner. If you wich to see more of the realization process, the entire project is on a public github and is intended to ship open source. 
Have a look at the Github Repository here:

If Ällei is for some reason not present on the page here, check out the prototype page, also found in the Github Repo.

I regard this as a core question of both design and computation, really making tangible the prestructured way of our interaction with technology in general.
